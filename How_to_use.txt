STEPS TO USE THIS REPO.

--> Download the data
--> Download lableme annotator (This only works with this labelme, other annotator won't work)
--> Annotate your data(if you are using custom training) or use directly the training.json
--> Convert all the annotations into coco format using labelme2coco.py as we are using detectron2 model which is trained on coco dataset.
--> Zip your train data.
--> upload zipped train data and training.json on colab @ /content/train.zip and /content/training.json
--> unzip the train.zip
--> Follow the instruction in the ipynb file for Detectron2 installation
--> Start training if you are doing custom training or use the pretrained model model_final.pth
--> Use your model for prediction.
